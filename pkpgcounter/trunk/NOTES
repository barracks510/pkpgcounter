Programmer's notes :
====================

As per their respective specifications, both PS and PDF formats must 
accept the following EOL markers which should be treated equally 
(like with Universal Newline opening mode) : 

        \r\n
        \r
        \n
        
For obvious reasons, the plain text format should also accept        
these three forms of EOL markers.
        
The PJL statements MUST end with \n, so \r being present or not,
we are only interested in \n as the EOL marker.

We can't currently remove mmap calls for file formats which
don't need it (e.g. zjstream, lidil, ...) until we have removed
the universal newline opening mode. We can't remove this
opening mode until we have written some replacement, or
have a way for a parser to specify the mode in which
the file must be re-opened.
